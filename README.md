# Neural-Style-Transfer

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Neural Style Transfer is an optimization technique where we use a base image 
and a style image and blend them together so the output image looks like the
content of the first image, but “painted” in the style of the second image.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
--> file.py file contains the code for neural style transfer

--> Content Image folder - Contains base images.

--> Style Image folder - Contains style images.

--> Combined Image folder - Contains combined (base + style) images.
